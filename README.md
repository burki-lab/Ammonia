Internal workshop on git, Github and Jupyter - April 2022

## What is GitHub?
You may already be familiar with Git which is a software installed locally, used for managing your code. GitHub is an onine service for git users to connect and upload or download resources. 

## Why use GitHub?
- open science. 
- encourages reproducibility.  
- greater visibility (people are more likely to use your code and cite your papers if they can easily repeat/implement your analyses).  

## How should we use GitHub for the lab?  
[Example 1](http://envgen.github.io/) and [Example 2](https://github.com/PoisotLab). 

In general, it is a good idea to have a repository for each published paper/preprint (a repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history [for example](https://github.com/UU-Microbial-Eukaryotes/ebook/commits/main)).

Also a great idea to have a repository for scripts/workflows used regularly in the lab so that it's easier for newer members to build on previous work (e.g. the phylogenomics repo started by Harshall and the scripts repo). We can also have a repo for commonly used wet lab protocols (long-range PCRs). 

## Uploading code 
Got some scripts on your computer that you want to upload? Start off by signing-up for a GitHub account. You can also join "organizations" (the burki-lab is an organization on GitHub). Choose or create a repo and then simply click on **Add file** --> **Upload files**. 

## A note on licensing
Without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. Therefore, for your work to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software.

GitHub will let you pick a license whenever you create a new repository, or you can add one at a later step. Here are a couple of resources to help you choose a license:
